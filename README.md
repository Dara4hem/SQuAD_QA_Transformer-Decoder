# Question Answering with T5 Transformer

This project implements a question-answering task using the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model, fine-tuned on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The T5 model is capable of understanding and generating human-like text, making it suitable for various NLP tasks, including question answering.

## Features

- Fine-tuning the T5 model on the SQuAD dataset
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Support for loading pre-trained models from Hugging Face
- Metrics and visualizations for model performance

## Dataset

The project uses the SQuAD dataset, a popular benchmark for machine reading comprehension. The dataset can be downloaded automatically using the Hugging Face Datasets library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Hugging Face Datasets
- tqdm
- pandas

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**

   Run the following command to fine-tune the T5 model on the SQuAD dataset:

   ```bash
   python t5_qa_training.py --dataset squad --model t5-small
   ```

2. **Evaluating the Model**

   After training, evaluate the model's performance:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py --model_path output/t5_qa_model
   ```

3. **Inference**

   Use the trained model to answer custom questions:

   ```bash
   python inference.py --question "What is T5?" --context "T5 is a text-to-text transfer transformer model..."
   ```

## Results

| Metric        | Score  |
|---------------|--------|
| Exact Match   | 59.2%  |
| F1 Score      | 88.4%  |
